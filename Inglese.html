        <h2>Who is Alan Turing?</h2>
        <p>
          Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptographer and philosopher.
          He was considered one of the fathers of computer science and one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.
          Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the UK's leading cryptanalysis center,
          where he devised a series of techniques for breaking German ciphers and built an electromechanical machine
          capable of decoding codes created by the Enigma cryptographic machine.
          Alan Turing's activity in the Bletchley Park group was covered by an absolute secrecy.
          At the end of the Second World War the British government imposed on those who had worked at
          encryption to break German, Japanese and Italian cryptographic codes,
          the prohibition of speaking or writing about any subject dealt with in that period. This prevented that Turing
          and his colleagues received the accolades that would have been extensively theirs elsewhere e
          publicly recognized. Information on these activities began to be published,
          by the British secret services, in 1974, when Turing and many of his colleagues were long dead.
